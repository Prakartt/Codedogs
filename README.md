Our team includes Sai Kamal, Prachet Balaji and Sidhant Malik currently pursuing 2nd year computer science. 
This website presents our attempt at frontend developement.
The website contains 6 pages which are the HomePage,Bedroom,Living Room,Kitchen,Contact us and about us.It is easy to navigate and understand.

We expanded our learning on Javascript to make basic navigation and object cards.We became well versed in HTML and CSS in order to provide a smooth experience to the user.
As all three of us worked on different pages , we faced problems integrating the entire site.
