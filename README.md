Our team includes Sai Kamal, Prachet Balaji and Sidhant Malik currently pursuing 2nd year computer science. <br>
This website presents our attempt at frontend developement.<br>
The website contains 6 pages which are the HomePage,Bedroom,Living Room,Kitchen,Contact us and about us.It is easy to navigate and understand.<br>

We expanded our learning on Javascript to make basic navigation and object cards.We became well versed in HTML and CSS in order to provide a smooth experience to the user.<br>
As all three of us worked on different pages , we faced problems integrating the entire site.<br>
